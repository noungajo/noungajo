### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 
Hi, i'm **Noutcha Ngapi J.**, a passionate computer scientist and a self-taught full-stack software engineer. I'm an @holbertonschool trainee software engineer. My passion for software lies in dreaming up ideas and turning them into elegant interfaces and innovative processes for making life easier for people. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build. I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. I learned a lot from the open-source community and i love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source. In my spare time, I'm a handyman, I touch everything. Because I believe that no science is above my understanding.
Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C/C++, python, MySQL, Webstack debugging, dart,
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on on app creation and artificial intelligence projects.
